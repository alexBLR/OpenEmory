Release 0.2.x - Harvesting
--------------------------

Harvest metadata from PubMed Central for articles written by Emory authors.
Do not publish this metadata immediately, but allow site admins to decide
whether or not to publish it.

**Internal prototype: Not for production release**

 * An admin user can designate other users as admin users in order to share
   the work of the maintaining the site.
 * When an admin user logs in, they are redirected to a queue of PubMed
   articles targeted for harvesting so that they can review items and select
   them for ingest.
 * Admin users looking at the harvesting queue have access to the metadata,
   the PubMed ID, a link to the PubMed entry and the associated user to
   enable selection for ingest.
 * When looking at an item in the harvesting queue, an admin user can click
   "ingest" to indicate that the item should be scheduled for harvest, and
   disappear from the harvesting queue.
 * When looking at an item in the harvesting queue, an admin user can click
   "ignore" to indicate that the item should be ignored & disappear from the
   harvesting queue.

   faculty profile pages with links to PubMed for content so they can read
   articles or metadata about articles by Emory authors.
