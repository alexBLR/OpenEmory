Release 0.4.x - Article Metadata
--------------------------------
Attach searchable MODS descriptive metadata to articles. Authors can edit
this metadata as they are uploading the document. Further edits are the
responsibility of site admins.

**Internal prototype: Not for production release**

 * When an author successfully uploads an article, they see a form where
   they can edit article metadata before that article is visible to the
   public so that they can describe the item correctly before publishing it.
 * When editing article metadata, an author can specify free text values
   for: title, funding groups (multiple), journal title, journal publisher,
   volume, issue, page numbers, abstract, author notes, and keywords so they
   can describe the item correctly.
 * An author can click a "publish" button to save the metadata form and
   populate the record in the repository so that an item record can be
   displayed on the website. (Redirect to profile after successful publish).
 * When an author uploads an article, the type of resource is prepopulated
   as text, the file format as PDF, and the genre as article, so that the
   items are sharable and identifiable according to the requirements of
   MODS.
 * When editing article metadata, an author can specify co-authors by netid
   in order to credit colleagues and share metadata maintenance permission.
   The system will automatically assign these authors an Emory University
   institutional affiliation.
 * An author can specify a name (with an optional institutional affiliation)
   as a co-author instead of a netid so that they can include non-Emory
   co-authors. If they do, then the author name will not be linked to a
   profile.
 * An author can remove a co-author by deleting their name or netid and
   saving the form so that they can correct errors.
 * When editing article metadata, an author is required to specify whether
   an article is a pre-print, post-print, or final published version, so
   that users know which version of an authoritative peer-reviewed scholarly
   article they are downloading.
 * When editing article metadata, an author can specify the date of
   publication, with the year required and the month and day optional so
   that users can identify when the article was first published.
 * When editing article metadata, an author can specify a URL and/or DOI for
   the final published version of the article so that readers can access
   this version. The URL will be verified when the form is saved.
 * When editing article metadata, an author can specify additional URLs
   associated with the article (PubMed, other repository, etc) so that
   readers can find more information about it.
 * When editing article metadata, an author is required to select a text
   language from a drop-down menu in which the first option is English so
   that readers can decide whether to download the article. If no language
   is selected, the value will default to English.
 * When editing article metadata, an author can select subject headings
   taken from the ETD list of ProQuest research fields to aid searchability.
   Use same options and configuration available in ETD's, but hide numbers
   associated with field names.
 * When editing an article's funding group, journal title, journal
   publisher, keywords, or co-author affiliation, an author will be prompted
   with suggestions pulled from existing entries to those fields to improve
   normalization of data and reduce errors.
 * When an author is editing an article, they can click a "save" button to
   save their changes without publishing, so they can revise the record
   later.
 * When an author is editing an article and navigates away or closes the
   browser, they will see a warning if they have unsaved changes so they do
   not lose their work.
 * When an author logs in, they will see a list of any unpublished records
   on their profile page, so that they can edit and publish those items.
 * An anonymous user can view a published item record page, populated by the
   article's full metadata, so that they can decide whether to download it.
   This page should include a link to download the article as well as a
   permanent id (ARK/DOI) for the article.
 * When an author publishes an article, it will appear immediately in search
   and browse results and on any Emory author profile pages, so that the
   article can be viewed immediately.
 * An admin can view a list of recently published, un-reviewed items, so
   that they can select an item to review.
 * An admin can review and edit a published article, and mark it as
   "reviewed," for quality control on metadata. Once an article has been
   marked as "reviewed," the author can no longer edit it. Once an article
   has been marked as "reviewed," the review event will be recorded (date
   and user) and displayed for admins.
 * Admins will see an edit link for each article in every search, browse,
   and display view, so they can easily find and edit items from anywhere in
   the site.
 * A user browsing search results can see author names (rather than netID)
   to provide correct citation information.


Release 0.3.x - Searching and Social
------------------------------------
Full-text searching of articles, and basic social features. Users can add
private tags to articles as well as use tagging systems to indicate their
own research interests.

**Internal prototype: Not for production release**

 * Anonymous users can search for words or phrases that appear anywhere in
   the full-text (PDF or PMC xml) or available metadata, in order to find
   relevant articles. 
 * Anonymous users who search for articles can see results with relevancy
   score, title, author, date uploaded, and context highlighting, so that
   they can determine which articles to view.
 * An authenticated user can enter a public research interest on their
   profile page so that they can indicate their research interests (with
   auto-suggest based on existing public research interests).
 * An authenticated user entering a tag will be given suggestions from their
   own previous tags, so that they can be consistent in their tagging.
 * An unauthenticated user can view researcher interests on a user's profile
   pages and click on them to see other researchers with those interests.
 * An authenticated user looking at research interest page can click a
   button/link to add that research interest to their own profile.
 * Authenticated users viewing search results, profile listings, or a single
   article can add and edit private tags on any article so that they can
   refer to them later.
 * An authenticated user can view their own tags in a sidebar on any page so
   that they can access the articles they've tagged from anywhere in the
   site.
 * When an authenticated user clicks on one of their tags, they're brought
   to a list of articles with that tag so that they can select which article
   to view.


Release 0.2.x - Harvesting
--------------------------
Harvest metadata from PubMed Central for articles written by Emory authors.
Do not publish this metadata immediately, but allow site admins to decide
whether or not to publish it.

**Internal prototype: Not for production release**

 * An admin user can designate other users as admin users in order to share
   the work of the maintaining the site.
 * When an admin user logs in, they are redirected to a queue of PubMed
   articles targeted for harvesting so that they can review items and select
   them for ingest.
 * Admin users looking at the harvesting queue have access to the metadata,
   the PubMed ID, a link to the PubMed entry and the associated user to
   enable selection for ingest.
 * When looking at an item in the harvesting queue, an admin user can click
   "ingest" to indicate that the item should be scheduled for harvest, and
   disappear from the harvesting queue.
 * When looking at an item in the harvesting queue, an admin user can click
   "ignore" to indicate that the item should be ignored & disappear from the
   harvesting queue.
 * An unauthenticated user can view items ingested from PubMed harvest on
   faculty profile pages with links to PubMed for content so they can read
   articles or metadata about articles by Emory authors.


Release 0.1.x - Initial Prototype
---------------------------------
First working system prototype. Emory users can authenticate, ingest
content, and edit metadata for items. Unauthenticated users can view
ingested content and user profiles.

**Internal prototype: Not for production release**

 * An anonymous user enters the site through a landing page that includes a
   login box so they can start to upload.
 * An anonymous user can log into the site using Emory credentials to allow
   them to manage their own content. New Task
 * An authenticated user can use a web form to ingest a PDF into the repository
   to ensure enduring access and discoverability of that file.
 * An anonymous user can view any user's basic user profile page, which lists
   information about the user and the items they have uploaded so they can
   view and download those items.
 * An authenticated user is redirected to their profile, which includes a link
   for ingesting content to give them a personalized jumping-off "home"
   point for other functionality.
 * A file owner can create and edit bibliographic metadata about a file they
   have previously ingested to better identify it and to improve
   discoverability.
