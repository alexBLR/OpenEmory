Notes for Developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following instructions can be ignored when deploying to a staging
or production environment, but may be helpful to a developer working
on the project or running automated tests.

Session configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, this project is configured to mark Session cookies as
secure.  To enable login over HTTP (e.g., when developing with
Django's runserver), you will need to override this in your
``localsettings.py``.  See the example and comments in
``localsettings.py.dist``.

Test Setup
^^^^^^^^^^

Certain unit tests pass test user credentials to Fedora, in order to test and
simulate accessing Fedora as the logged in user.  For tests to work properly,
the unit test user should be defined (with appropriate permissions)
as a fedora account.  See :mod:`openemory.publication.tests` for account details.
