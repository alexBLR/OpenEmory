DNA polymerase gamma (pol <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>) replicates mtDNA, whereas thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) monophosphorylates pyrimidines intramitochondrially. Point mutations in <italic>POLG</italic> and <italic>TK2</italic> result in clinical diseases associated with mtDNA depletion and organ dysfunction. Pyrimidine analogs (NRTIs) inhibit Pol <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> and mtDNA replication. Cardiac &#x0201c;dominant negative&#x0201d; murine transgenes (TGs; Pol <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> Y955G, and TK2 H121N or I212N) defined the role of each in the heart. mtDNA abundance, histopathological features, histochemistry, mitochondrial protein abundance, morphometry, and echocardiography were determined for TGs in &#x0201c;2 &#x000d7; 2&#x0201d; studies with or without pyrimidine analogs. Cardiac mtDNA abundance decreased in Y955C TGs (&#x0223c;50%) but increased in H121N and I212N TGs (20-70%). Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) increased in hearts of all mutants. Ultrastructural changes occurred in Y955C and H121N TGs. Histopathology demonstrated hypertrophy in H121N, LV dilation in I212N, and both hypertrophy and dilation in Y955C TGs. Antiretrovirals increased LV mass (&#x02248;50%) for all three TGs which combined with dilation indicates cardiomyopathy. Taken together, these studies demonstrate three manifestations of cardiac dysfunction that depend on the nature of the specific mutation and antiretroviral treatment. Mutations in genes for mtDNA biogenesis increase risk for defective mtDNA replication, leading to LV hypertrophy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cardiomyopathy</kwd><kwd>Murine model</kwd><kwd>mtDNA</kwd><kwd>NRTI</kwd><kwd>Toxicity</kwd></kwd-group><contract-num rid="HL1">R01 HL079867-02</contract-num><contract-num rid="HL1">R01 HL059798-09</contract-num><contract-num rid="DK1">K01 DK078513-01A1</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="HL1">National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute : NHLBI</contract-sponsor><contract-sponsor id="DK1">National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases : NIDDK</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front></article>

Delay intervals of 2 sec and 2 min were used between the initial viewing of a picture and when the picture was displayed alongside a novel picture. Eye-tracking revealed that at the 2 second delay, 6 mild cognitively impaired patients (MCI), 15 matched control subjects (NC), and 4 neurological control subject's with Parkinson's Disease (PD) performed comparably, i.e., viewed the novel picture greater than 71% of the time. When the delay increased to 2 minutes, MCI patients viewed the novel picture only 53% of the time (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .05), while NC and PD remained above 70%. These findings are consistent with the idea that the MCI patients did not remember well which picture was recently viewed. These findings demonstrate the usefulness of this task for assessing normal as well as impaired memory function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mild cognitive impairment</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's Disease</kwd><kwd>eye tracking</kwd><kwd>early diagnosis</kwd><kwd>visual paired comparison</kwd><kwd>preferential looking</kwd></kwd-group><contract-num rid="RR1">P51 RR000165-485928</contract-num><contract-num rid="RR1">P51 RR000165-477517</contract-num><contract-num rid="RR1">P51 RR000165-460340</contract-num><contract-num rid="RR1">P51 RR000165-460284</contract-num><contract-num rid="RR1">P51 RR000165-457309</contract-num><contract-num rid="RR1">P51 RR000165-450161</contract-num><contract-num rid="AG1">P50 AG025688-050001</contract-num><contract-num rid="AG1">P50 AG025688-040001</contract-num><contract-num rid="AG1">P50 AG025688-030001</contract-num><contract-num rid="AG1">P50 AG025688-020001</contract-num><contract-num rid="AG1">P50 AG025688-010001</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="RR1">National Center for Research Resources : NCRR</contract-sponsor><contract-sponsor id="AG1">National Institute on Aging : NIA</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front></article>

Although black/African Americans are disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS, their participation in HIV clinical research continues to have unique challenges. We theorize that interaction among multilevel factors creates ideal alignment for minority participation in HIV clinical studies. Thus, we initially set out to test an extended model of reasoned action with 362 participants to understand the interplay of sociopsychological and network-level considerations influencing minority participation in HIV prevention research efforts. In this study, we linked the intrapersonal dimensions of attitudes, beliefs, and normative concerns to community-level components, appraisal of involvement with the clinical research organization, an entity which operates within a networked structure of community partner agencies, and identification with coalition advocacy aims. Various participatory outcomes were explored including involvement in future HIV vaccine community functions, participation in community promotion of HIV vaccine research, and community mobilization. Three-stage least squares estimates indicated similar findings across three models. Significant effects demonstrate the importance of positive attitudes toward HIV vaccine research, favorable health research beliefs, perceived social support for participation, HIV/AIDS issue engagement, and perceived relevance of the clinical research site&#x02019;s mission and values. Identification of these nuanced pathway effects provides implications for tailored community program development.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HIV/AIDS</kwd><kwd>HIV vaccine</kwd><kwd>African Americans</kwd><kwd>Community engagement</kwd><kwd>Willingness to participate</kwd></kwd-group><contract-num rid="AI1">U01 AI069418-01

Although a mechanism for XMRV carcinogenesis is yet to be established, this virus belongs to the family of gammaretroviruses well known for their ability to induce cancer in the infected hosts. Since its original identification XMRV has been detected in several independent investigations; however, at this time significant controversy remains regarding reports of XMRV detection/prevalence in other cohorts and cell type/tissue distribution. The potential risk of human infection, coupled with the lack of knowledge about the basic biology of XMRV, warrants further research, including investigation of adaptive immune responses. To study immunogenicity <italic>in vivo</italic>, we vaccinated mice with a combination of recombinant vectors expressing codon-optimized sequences of XMRV <italic>gag</italic> and <italic>env</italic> genes and virus-like particles (VLP) that had the size and morphology of live infectious XMRV.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Immunization elicited Env-specific binding and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against XMRV in mice. The peak titers for ELISA-binding antibodies and NAb were 1&#x02236;1024 and 1&#x02236;464, respectively; however, high ELISA-binding and NAb titers were not sustained and persisted for less than three weeks after immunizations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Vaccine-induced XMRV Env antibody titers were transiently high, but their duration was short. The relatively rapid diminution in antibody levels may in part explain the differing prevalences reported for XMRV in various prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome cohorts. The low level of immunogenicity observed in the present study may be characteristic of a natural XMRV infection in humans.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) was first identified through microarray analysis of human prostate cancer (PC) samples from patients with an inherited defect in RNASEL (R462Q variant), a downstream effector of the antiviral interferon defense pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Urisman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Dong1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The presence of gammaretroviral genomes was further confirmed by <italic>gag</italic>-specific nested RT-PCR and FISH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Dong1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on sequence analysis, XMRV is closely related to mouse exogenous gammaretroviruses that are known to cause leukemias and lymphomas in different host species. Since its original identification, XMVR has been detected in several independent investigations. In one study XMRV was isolated from the prostate carcinoma cell line 22Rv1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Knouf1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Multiple XMRV chromosomal integration sites were found in the 22Rv1 cell line as well as in that of cancer tissues of PC patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Kim1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Although it does not have common integration sites within or near proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Knouf1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, XMRV shows preferences for integration near cancer breakpoints, common fragile sites and microRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Kim1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Additional evidence for XMRV came from a study that analyzed a large cohort of patients with different stages of PC as well as healthy men, which revealed the prevalence of XMRV in malignant epithelial cells and an association with more aggressive tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Schlaberg1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. This study expanded the population of PC patients infected with XMRV to include those with normal RNASEL. Moreover, our recent publication further demonstrated the prevalence of XMRV in prostate tissue derived from an independent cohort of PC patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Arnold1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. This study showed concordance between the presence of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) and XMRV nucleic acids detected by nested PCR and FISH. Another independent study has shown that XMRV is detectable in normal and tumor prostate tissue from patients with PC from the southern United States <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Danielson1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to being identified in PC samples, evidence for XMRV was also found in a study of subjects with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) that revealed the presence of XMRV in activated human B and T cells as well as detectable levels of anti-XMRV Env antibodies in nine out of 18 CFS human plasma samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Lombardi1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In another recent study, a second related polytropic MLV-like virus was detected in separate cohort of 37 CFS subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Lo1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Collectively these studies provide evidence for infection of humans by these newly identified viruses that belong to a family of viruses that cause significant pathogenesis in their natural hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Dong1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Schlaberg1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to the studies mentioned above, XMRV was not found in PC and CFS patient cohorts from several European and US studies. Studies of the prevalence of XMRV in two PC patient cohorts in Germany found, for example, no link between prostate cancer and the presence of XMRV when DNA or RNA from tumor samples was analyzed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Fischer1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Hohn1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, analyses of CFS cohorts from England and Netherlands failed to detect XMRV using PCR analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Groom1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Erlwein1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-vanKuppeveld1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Likewise, an ELISA-based screen of antibodies in plasma of PC patients detected no XMRV-specific responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Hohn1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and no antibodies against XMRV were found in sera of CFS patients when XMRV pseudoviruses were used in a neutralization assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Groom1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In a study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there was no evidence of XMRV infection in 50 CFS patients or 56 healthy controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Switzer1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Some have speculated that geographical restrictions account for the differences in detecting XMRV; however, the fact that the assays and reagents varied among the studies described above may also have contributed to the differences in findings. Thus, additional investigations are needed to sort out those discrepancies and reveal the true prevalence of XMRV infection.</p><p>In our recent study of XMRV serological prevalence in a cohort of PC patients, we observed approximately 25&#x00025; positivity for serum XMRV antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Arnold1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>; however, despite this relatively high incidence, the XMRV antibody titers were low overall compared to those of HIV-1 infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Vogel1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-vanGils1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. To provide an explanation for the low magnitude of immune responses observed in our PC cohort, we initiated a study of XMRV immune responses in a murine model. We hypothesized that low immunogenicity is an inherent characteristic of an XMRV infection. To test this hypothesis, we vaccinated mice to elucidate the magnitude and duration of the antibody response against the XMRV Env antigen.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>XMRV pseudovirus and NAb assay</title><p>An HIV-1 pseudovirus-based assay has been widely used for the detection of NAb in sera from HIV-1 infected patients and experimentally infected/vaccinated animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Montefiori1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Li1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore adapted the assay using an XMRV pseudovirus to determine the utility of such an approach for detecting XMRV NAbs. The infectivities of the XMRV and control HIV-1 pseudoviruses were compared by monitoring the levels of &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression in TZM-BL cells after 48 hours of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018272-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, black columns). The results indicated that the XMRV pseudovirus is &#x0223c;250 times more infectious than the control HIV-1 pseudovirus. The difference in infectivity between the two pseudoviruses was not due to <italic>de novo</italic> virus production, since the p24 protein compositions of the XMRV and HIV-1 pseudoviruses were the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018272-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, grey columns). It is likely that the difference in infectivity is due to the codon-optimization algorithm that was used to synthesize the XMRV <italic>env</italic> gene, whereas the HIV-1 <italic>env</italic> gene used in this experiment was not codon-optimized. We next determined whether the XMRV pseudovirus could be employed in a NAb assay using monoclonal antibodies (mAb) b12 and 83A25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018272-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The mAb b12, which interacts with the CD4-binding site on the HIV-1 Env glycoprotein, efficiently neutralized the HIV-1 pseudovirus but did not neutralize the XMRV pseudovirus. Conversely, mAb 83A25, which has been shown to neutralize several related MuLV strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Burkhart1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, inhibited infection of the XMRV pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on the infectivity of HIV-1 pseudovirus. We then compared the XMRV and HIV-1 pseudoviruses in the NAb assay using polyclonal antibodies (PAb) produced against Friend MuLV virus. The PAb neutralized the XMRV pseudovirus over a wide dilution range, but did not inhibit the HIV-1 pseudovirus at any dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018272-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). The neutralizing antibody titer that reduced XMRV infection by 50&#x00025; (NT50) was &#x0223c;1&#x02236;8300. Collectively, these data demonstrate that (1) the XMRV Env can be pseudotyped onto HIV-1 viral particles and that these XMRV pseudoviruses can (2) efficiently infect the reporter cell line TZM-BL and (3) be used to detect XMRV-specific antibodies with specificity and sensitivity over a wide range of dilutions.</p><fig id="pone-0018272-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0018272.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Characterization of XMRV pseudovirus and single-round neutralization assay.</title><p>(A) Comparison of XMRV and control HIV-1 pseudoviruses in yield (p24 accumulation) and infectivity (IU/ml on TZM-bl cells).

XMRV <italic>gag</italic> gene product expression was determined by infecting HeLa cells with Ad5-XMRV, followed by a Western blot analysis using mAb R187 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Dong1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, which showed the Gag precursor at &#x0223c;65 kDa (Lane 1, top arrow) and a cleaved lower molecular mass Gag protein (Lane 1, bottom arrow) in the cytosolic lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018272-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The latter is likely to be a product of non-specific cleavage by host proteases, since the viral protease was not expressed. Only the immature Gag protein was detected after pelleting the media through a sucrose cushion (Lane 2), since VLP do not contain virus specific proteases that are required for Gag maturation.

In this regard, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) we detected XMRV VLP in HeLa cells infected with Ad5-XMRV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018272-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, Panels I and II). XMRV VLP budding was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018272-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, Panel I) that was comparable to virus budding from DU145-C7 cells that produce infectious XMRV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018272-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, Panels III and IV). We also observed an accumulation of XMRV VLP in intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018272-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, Panel I) and their dispersal throughout the cytosol of the cells infected with Ad5-XMRV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018272-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, Panel II). This observation suggests that VLP may also assemble within multivesicular bodies (MVP) in which case Env is recycled from the plasma membrane and then interacts with Gag on the MVP membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Spearman1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, we expected that our DNA prime/Ad5 boost regiment would stimulate XMRV-specific immune responses. To determine the immunogenicity of XMRV Env, Balb/C mice (10 animals per group) were primed with pDP1-XMRV<italic>envgag</italic> plasmid on Day 0, and then boosted with recombinant Ad5-XMRV at 22 and 50 days after priming.

It is important to note that the only difference between these XMRV and HIV-1 pseudoviruses is the Env protein; therefore, neutralizing activity detected in the immune serum is primarily directed against XMRV Env rather than against host cell proteins incorporated into the lipid membrane, which can be major antibody targets when using VLP- or virion-based immunogens produced in host cells from a different species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Hammonds1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Immunization elicits XMRV NAb</title><p>We next purified total immunoglobulin (Ig) from the immune and control sera to further characterize the serum neutralizing activity.

Though speculative at this point, there are several possibilities to explain this result. One explanation is that glycosylation of the Env proteins could conceal some of the antigenic sites necessary for the host to mount a robust neutralizing immune response, as this is known to occur with other retroviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Wyatt1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. It is also possible that partial tolerance due to the presence of endogenous murine retroviruses may have diminished the immunogenicity of the XMRV Env protein in the mouse model that we used here. In this regard, it has been shown that human and murine endogenous retroviruses can account for the lack of immunogenicity of some tumor-associated viral antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Bronte1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. To test this possibility we are currently investigating XMRV immunity in rabbit and non-human primate models. Another possibility is that the XMRV Env has immunosuppressive activity that reduces its immunogenicity, which has been shown with related murine and primate Env proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-SchlechtLouf1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Blaise1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Mangeney1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. With these considerations in mind, ongoing studies are underway to optimize the immunization regime.</p><p>Discrepancies among current reports on XMRV prevalence, and gaps in what is known about its role in transformation, transmission and pathogenesis, provide an impetus for basic investigation of XMRV and the development of standardized detection assays. We undertook the present study in order to determine the immunogenicity of the XMRV Env in an experimental model and, in the process, developed ELISA and NAb assays for measuring anti-XMRV immunity. Here we demonstrate that the XMRV Env protein is immunogenic in a mouse model but that the resulting antibody responses are low in magnitude and short in duration. We have previously observed similarly low levels of XMRV antibodies in a study of 40 PC patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Arnold1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and in an expanded cohort of nearly 300 PC patients (unpublished). The results of our current study are also in line with those of a recent report of XMRV infection in a non-human primate model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018272-Qiu1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. That study revealed a pattern of relatively low antibody induction following the initial XMRV infection, and showed that this was only modestly boosted by a second infection 158 days later. Moreover, the antibody titers in that study decreased after both the prime and boost infections using live XMRV.

Using this model may provide opportunities to evaluate XMRV with regard to its pathogenesis, replication and vaccine-induced protection from infection. Lastly, our study raises the possibility that low immunogenicity may be an intrinsic characteristic of XMRV, which could in part account for some of the reported discrepancies in detecting XMRV in various patient cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, binding and neutralizing antibody responses elicited by XMRV VLP vaccination in a mouse model were characterized.

Copper deficiency in the United States is believed to be relatively rare but has been described in the setting of zinc supplementation, myelodysplastic syndrome, use of parenteral nutrition and chronic tube feeding, and in various malabsorptive syndromes, including following gastrectomy and gastric bypass surgery. Features of copper deficiency include hematologic abnormalities (anemia, neutropenia, and leukopenia) and myeloneuropathy; the latter is a rarer and often unrecognized complication of copper deficiency. We here describe two patients who presented with severe gait abnormalities and anemia combined with neutropenia several years after roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery for obesity who were found to be severely copper deficient. Intravenous copper repletion resulted in the rapid correction of hematologic indices; combined intravenous and oral copper supplementation and eventual oral copper supplements alone normalized serum copper levels in each patient but resulted in only partial resolution of the neurologic deficits. This report serves to alert physicians of the association between RYGB procedures and subsequent copper deficiency in order to avoid diagnostic delays and to improve treatment outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Copper deficiency</kwd><kwd>gastric bypass surgery</kwd><kwd>neutropenia</kwd><kwd>myelopathy</kwd><kwd>anemia</kwd></kwd-group><contract-num rid="RR1">K24 RR023356-02</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="RR1">National Center for Research Resources : NCRR</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front></article>

                    Nevertheless, survival for patients with glioblastoma, the most aggressive
                    glioma, although individually variable, has improved from an average of 10
                    months to 14 months after diagnosis in the last 5 years due to improvements in
                    the standard of care. Radiotherapy has been of key importance to the treatment
                    of these lesions for decades, and the ability to focus the beam and tailor it to
                    the irregular contours of brain tumors and minimize the dose to nearby critical
                    structures with intensity-modulated or image-guided techniques has improved
                    greatly. Temozolomide, an alkylating agent with simple oral administration and a
                    favorable toxicity profile, is used in conjunction with and after radiotherapy.
                    Newer surgical techniques, such as fluorescence-guided resection and
                    neuroendoscopic approaches, have become important in the management of malignant
                    gliomas. Furthermore, new discoveries are being made in basic and translational
                    research, which are likely to improve this situation further in the next 10
                    years. These include agents that block 1 or more of the disordered tumor
                    proliferation signaling pathways, and that overcome resistance to already
                    existing treatments. Targeted therapies such as antiangiogenic therapy with
                    antivascular endothelial growth factor antibodies (bevacizumab) are finding
                    their way into clinical practice. Large-scale research efforts are ongoing to
                    provide a comprehensive understanding of all the genetic alterations and gene
                    expression changes underlying glioma formation. These have already refined the
                    classification of glioblastoma into 4 distinct molecular entities that may lead
                    to different treatment regimens. The role of cancer stem-like cells is another
                    area of active investigation. There is definite hope that by 2020, new cocktails
                    of drugs will be available to target the key molecular pathways involved in
                    gliomas and reduce their mortality and morbidity, a positive development for
                    patients, their families, and medical professionals alike.</p></abstract><contract-num rid="NS1">K08 NS053454-05

Estimates suggest that these elements have generated millions of new germline insertions in individual human genomes worldwide. Unfortunately, current technologies are not capable of detecting most of these young insertions, and the true extent of germline mutagenesis by endogenous human retrotransposons has been difficult to examine. Here, we describe new technologies for detecting these young retrotransposon insertions and demonstrate that such insertions indeed are abundant in human populations. We also found that new somatic L1 insertions occur at high frequencies in human lung cancer genomes. Genome-wide analysis suggests that altered DNA methylation may be responsible for the high levels of L1 mobilization observed in these tumors. Our data indicate that transposon-mediated mutagenesis is extensive in human genomes, and is likely to have a major impact on human biology and diseases.</p></abstract><contract-num rid="HG1">R01 HG002898-06

We isolated epithelia-like ARCaP<sub>E</sub> from parental ARCaP cells and induced them to undergo epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition (EMT) by exposing these cells to soluble factors including TGF<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 plus EGF, IGF-1, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>2-microglobulin (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>2-m), or a bone microenvironment. The molecular and behavioral characteristics of the resultant ARCaP<sub>M</sub> were characterized extensively in comparison to the parental ARCaP<sub>E</sub> cells. In addition to expressing mesenchymal biomarkers, ARCaP<sub>M</sub> gained 100% incidence of bone metastasis. ARCaP<sub>M</sub> cells express receptor activator of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B ligand (RANKL), which was shown to increase tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclasts in culture, and when metastatic to bone in vivo. We provide evidence that RANKL expression was promoted by increased cell signaling mediated by the activation of Stat3-Snail-LIV-1. RANKL expressed by ARCaP<sub>M</sub> cells is functional both in vitro and in vivo. The lesson we learned from the ARCaP model of EMT is that activation of a specific cell signaling pathway by soluble factors can lead to increased bone turnover, mediated by enhanced RANKL expression by tumor cells, which is implicated in the high incidence of prostate cancer bone colonization. The AR-CaP EMT model is highly attractive for developing new therapeutic agents to treat prostate cancer bone metastasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>EMT</kwd><kwd>Cell signaling</kwd><kwd>RANKL</kwd><kwd>Osteoclastogenesis</kwd><kwd>LIV-1</kwd><kwd>Bone metastasis</kwd><kwd>Prostate</kwd><kwd>Breast</kwd><kwd>Lung</kwd><kwd>Kidney</kwd><kwd>TGF<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1</kwd><kwd>EGF</kwd></kwd-group><contract-num rid="CA1">R01 CA076620-01A1

Together, these data suggest that plasma Cys redox potential is not only a biomarker of oxidative stress, but may also be a determinant of immune cell function. Because a number of dietary and behavioral risk factors for disease are known to oxidize Cys redox potential e.g., sulfur amino acid deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Nkabyo1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, alcohol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Yeh1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, and smoking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Moriarty1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>; this provides a mechanistic basis to consider monitoring Cys redox potential as a risk factor for pro-inflammatory states, and consider interventional strategies to control oxidation of Cys redox potential in pro-inflammatory diseases.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that induction of IL-1&#x003b2; by non-infectious extracellular stimuli, such as ATP and cigarette smoke condensate, occurs by activation of membrane-bound receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Cruz1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Doz1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanism by which oxidized extracellular E<sub>h</sub> Cys/CySS induces pro-IL-1&#x003b2; is unknown, but likely involves the generation of intracellular ROS signaled, in part, via oxidation of membrane-bound thiols. Studies in endothelial cells have revealed increased oxidation of cell-surface protein thiols, induction of intracellular ROS, and activation of NF-&#x0039a;B in response to an oxidizing extracellular E<sub>h</sub> Cys/CySS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Go1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The rapid and sustained induction of cellular ROS by oxidized E<sub>h</sub> in the present study is consistent with the same type of mechanism in U937 cells, i.e., the increase in IL-1&#x003b2; by oxidized E<sub>h</sub> could be signaled via the membrane and involve ROS-dependent activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as NF-&#x0039a;B. Interestingly, the increase in ROS by oxidized E<sub>h</sub> occurred in the absence of changes to intracellular E<sub>h</sub> GSH/GSSG. This observation is, however, not unexpected. The major thiol/disulfide control systems GSH, thioredoxin, and Cys exist under non-equilibrium conditions and their redox states are distinctly modified by oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Moriarty1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, substrate availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Nkabyo1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Go2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Anderson1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, physiological <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Blanco1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> and pathological stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Hansen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Go2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, the present research shows that the oxidation of plasma E<sub>h</sub> Cys/CySS during acute endotoxemia <italic>in vivo</italic> occurs without the oxidation of plasma E<sub>h</sub> GSH/GSSG.</p><p>The acute oxidation of E<sub>h</sub> Cys/CySS by LPS is attenuated in mice supplemented with sulfur amino acids (SAA). This effect could be solely due to dietary augmentation of Cys reserves, an interpretation supported by the 1.4-fold higher plasma Cys concentrations in SAA-supplemented mice. However, plasma CySS does not increase in response to LPS suggesting the additional effects on ROS homeostasis due to SAA supplementation. The more reduced redox potential of the Cys/CySS couple in SAA-supplemented mice is associated with a significant decrease in circulating and tissue levels of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;. These data suggest that Cys and associated Cys redox potential are critical determinants of cytokine production during activation of the immune system by LPS in mice. Thus, preservation of E<sub>h</sub> Cys/CySS by SAA supplementation may be involved in decreased IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; levels during endotoxemia. It must be noted, however, that the effects of SAA supplementation may also include preservation of intracellular thiol/disulfide redox status.</p><p>In human nutrition, Cys is a conditionally essential amino acid because Cys requirements are normally met by the transulfuration of dietary methionine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Stipanuk1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Cys requirements increase during infection, injury, and in conditions associated with limited hepatic transulfuration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Malmezat1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Hunter1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Because Cys is not routinely added to solutions used in parenteral therapy, patients with sepsis could be particularly susceptible to a deficiency of Cys. Studies in humans have shown that plasma Cys redox potential is modulated fairly rapidly by precursor availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Blanco1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, in the present study we find that plasma Cys in humans in negatively associated with plasma IL-1&#x003b2; levels. Thus, nutritional supplementation with Cys or Cys precursors during early sepsis may be a strategy to alleviate acute inflammation and associated tissue injury.</p><p>In addition to the pathology associated with disregulated cytokine production in conditions such as sepsis; elevated cytokine levels in healthy individuals independently predict risk of chronic diseases such as type II diabetes and atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Cesari1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005017-Spranger1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the association between oxidized E<sub>h</sub> Cys/CySS and IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; in otherwise healthy individuals suggests that oxidized E<sub>h</sub> Cys/CySS may represent a risk factor for chronic inflammatory diseases. Accordingly, maintenance of Cys redox potential may be critical in protecting against subclinical inflammation in healthy individuals, and in ameliorating pathological processes associated with chronic inflammation. Large population studies with detailed measurements of known factors affecting redox potential along with pro-inflammatory cytokine markers and disease risk factors are needed to test this concept.

No statistically significant difference was observed between hemispheres for the number of active sites, COG distance or the RC slope. The magnitude and range of COG movement between sessions were similar to those reported previously with this muscle in able-bodied individuals. The average COG movement over three sessions in both hemispheres was 0.90 cm. The average COG movement in the affected hemisphere was 1.13 (&#x000b1; 0.08) cm, and 0.68 (&#x000b1; 0.04) cm) for the less affected hemisphere.

Recently, TMS has been used to explore mechanisms underlying both spontaneous and therapy-induced post-stroke motor recovery. In this context, most interventional studies have not considered intra-subject variability of TMS maps prior to the provision of a therapy, thus implying that cortical changes are attributable to the intervention. However, our laboratory recently demonstrated significant variability within able-bodied, right hand dominant participants across sessions and between hemispheres, for distance between the lowest resting motor threshold locations for a muscle (hotspot), center of gravity distance, and normalized map volume TMS parameters when mapping the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Adjusting for time and examining mean changes for hemispheres across sessions revealed that there was a 9-fold greater movement over sessions in the left hemisphere among these variables. Previous studies have shown reproducible motor maps of abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] in both healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and chronic stroke patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] using conventional electrode placement. In addition, Wasserman et al. (2002) found no systematic changes in resting and active motor evoked potential (MEP) thresholds among 19 women across three sessions.</p><p>However, few studies have examined the inherent variability in TMS motor maps in chronic stroke subjects not receiving an intervention. This preliminary study represents one of the first efforts to evaluate intra-subject variability in TMS motor maps of chronic stroke patients during three separate mapping sessions. As in a previous report on able-bodied participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], we chose to map EDC because this muscle is often affected by a stroke and its volitional activation is important in overcoming the profound flexion posture at the hand and wrist that characterizes many patients. Furthermore, the EDC is near the skin surface, making it a convenient and more precise site for electromyography recording due to its close proximity to other finger and wrist extensors which limits effects of cross talk, undesired overflow effects and, if present, volume-conducted pick up by muscles with comparable function.</p><p>Therefore, the present study is unique because of the specificity of recording using closely spaced electrodes and the repetitive sessions permitting examination of variability in TMS-related measures for the EDC muscle in patients greater than two years post stroke. The inherent variability seen in TMS measures following physical or pharmacological interventions would need to be less than that seen under non-interventional conditions to be assured that changes induced by these interventions are associated with cortical reorganization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This study used repeated measures, non-random sampling design. Motor maps for the EDC were created for each hemisphere during all three sessions for every subject. Sessions were separated by approximately seven days.</p></sec><sec><title>Chronic stroke patients</title><p>Ten right-handed patients who suffered a stroke greater than 2 years prior to testing were recruited using consecutive sampling of all chronic stroke patients who had the ability to extend &#x02265; 20&#x000b0; at the wrist and 10&#x000b0; at the fingers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Specific upper extremity motor deficits were similar to those seen in patients enrolled in a multisite randomized trial to investigate the effect of constraint-induced movement therapy in improving upper extremity function among adults recovering from a cerebrovascular stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The medical condition of each patient was stable. Each volunteer was living independently within the community and ambulated independently. For this preliminary study, patients with a wide range of cortical lesions and chronicity were studied. Basic information about age, gender, hand dominance, time since stroke and lesion site is found in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Four of ten patients had strokes that primarily affected their non-dominant upper extremity. Data from nine able-bodied volunteers collected in a previously reported TMS variability study were used as a comparison group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clinical data for patient volunteers.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>Participant</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Age</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Gender</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Hand Dom.</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Months since Stroke</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Site of Lesion</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">58</td><td align="center">Male</td><td align="center">R</td><td align="center">32</td><td align="left">Left Lacunar Infarct CVA</td></tr><tr><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">55</td><td align="center">Male</td><td align="center">R</td><td align="center">34</td><td align="left">Left thalamic ICH and right subcortical lacunae</td></tr><tr><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">78</td><td align="center">Male</td><td align="center">R</td><td align="center">35</td><td align="left">Right Internal capsule lacunar CVA</td></tr><tr><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">56</td><td align="center">Female</td><td align="center">R</td><td align="center">56</td><td align="left">Right cerebral hemisphere</td></tr><tr><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">46</td><td align="center">Female</td><td align="center">R</td><td align="center">54</td><td align="left">Right putamen hemorrhage</td></tr><tr><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">70</td><td align="center">Female</td><td align="center">R</td><td align="center">98</td><td align="left">Right cerebral hemisphere</td></tr><tr><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">60</td><td align="center">Female</td><td align="center">R</td><td align="center">147</td><td align="left">Left cerebral hemisphere</td></tr><tr><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">56</td><td align="center">Male</td><td align="center">R</td><td align="center">85</td><td align="left">Left cerebral hemisphere</td></tr><tr><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">56</td><td align="center">Male</td><td align="center">R</td><td align="center">33</td><td align="left">Left lacunar infarct corona radiate</td></tr><tr><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">67</td><td align="center">Female</td><td align="center">R</td><td align="center">25</td><td align="left">Left cerebellum</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Participants were excluded if they had: a history of epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, fracture in the upper extremity within the past two years, diaphoresis, severe spasticity, tendonitis in the upper extremity within the last three months, migraine headaches within the last six months, Attention Deficit Disorder, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

Briefly, the following variables were measured at each session: hotspot and active site locations, hotspot excitability threshold, average MEP amplitude for hotspot and active sites, and recruitment curve slope. The hotspot was defined as the grid location where the motor threshold was the lowest while evoking the largest response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Given the comparatively closer inter-electrode recording distances, active sites were designated as the grid locations where a response of &#x02265; 25 &#x003bc;V in 5 out of 10 trials at 110 percent of resting motor threshold was obtained. Each site with five consecutive responses less than 25 &#x003bc;V was considered non-active. Mapping was complete when locations adjacent to the active sites were identified as non-active. Recruitment curves were generated to evaluate the relationship between MEP amplitudes at the hotspot and progressively increasing stimulus intensities until the curve flattened. The slope of the recruitment curve is thought to be a function of the physical distribution of stimulus excitation from the coil and yields a measure of distribution of the excitability in the cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The average MEP amplitude for the hotspot, center of gravity (COG), normalized map volume, and slope of the recruitment curve, were calculated following data collection. COG was defined as the map location representing the amplitude-weighted center of the area of excitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Normalized map volume was defined as the area of the map multiplied by the normalized MEP amplitudes.</p><p>Normalization of mean amplitudes (nMEP) was completed for all coordinates for each participant by dividing the mean amplitudes by the maximum mean amplitude. The normalized map volume (nMV) was calculated by adding all of the nMEP amplitudes and multiplying by the area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The X and Y coordinates for each active site were multiplied by the normalized MEP amplitude (X*nMEP and Y*nMEP), and the sum of all the values was calculated respectively. The center of gravity (COG) X coordinate was calculated by <inline-graphic xlink:href="1743-0003-2-10-i1.gif"/> and COG Y coordinate was calculated by <inline-graphic xlink:href="1743-0003-2-10-i2.gif"/>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The recruitment curve (RC) was generated by examining MEP amplitudes at the hotspot over progressively increasing intensities, thus providing information about cortical excitability. This was done by placing the coil at the hotspot and recording 5 stimuli in 10% increments beginning at an intensity of 10 % below threshold. Data collection for the RC was terminated when a plateau of the sigmoidal curve was observed. When calculating the RC slope, the first two data points collected were omitted because they were at sub-threshold levels, and the end point of the recruitment curve was determined to be either at 80% stimulator output, where a supra-threshold motor response was observed, or once a plateau in the recruitment curve was noted. The slope of the recruitment curve was generated from the resultant data points using linear regression.</p><p>The MEPs were recorded using two 7 mm &#x000d7; 4 mm silver-silver chloride surface electrodes (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) separated by approximately 1.5 centimeters. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the unrectified MEP was measured automatically using custom established routines created in LabView 6.0 (National Instruments, Austin, TX) in each of the 10 trials in each block, and their average was calculated for each stimulus site to give the mean peak-to-peak amplitude.</p></sec><sec><title>Reliability</title><p>The reliability of data acquisition was assessed by two investigators. One investigator performed the stimulation, while the other monitored the recordings for all sessions. Each investigator performed the same duties throughout the study to decrease the chance of experimenter variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Potential participants were screened using an inclusion/exclusion criteria questionnaire. To ensure consistent electrode placement for all sessions, the EDC muscle belly was isolated by palpation and then marked at the first session. A clear acetate sheet was applied to each forearm. Marks were then placed on the acetate sheet for electrode placement and relevant anatomical landmarks to assure consistent placement during subsequent sessions. To maintain consistent cap placement across sessions, detailed distance recordings were made from the nasion, inion, and bilateral pre-tragus to the vertex.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><sec><title>Patient preparation</title><p>After isolating each EDC with the wrist in flexion to determine optimal placement of the electrodes, the skin surface over the EDC on the forearms was shaved and abraded with alcohol until erythemic responses appeared. Recording electrodes were placed on the skin over the EDC muscle bellies, and a reference electrode was applied ipsilaterally and proximally to the recording electrodes to reduce EMG noise levels. Skin impedance between active electrodes and between each active electrode and the reference were kept below 2 kilo-ohms (k&#x003a9;), and below 20 k&#x003a9; respectively.</p><p>Each participant was seated in a relaxed position with pillows placed under the forearms and hands. A firm-fitting cap upon which 1 cm<sup>2 </sup>grids had been imprinted was placed on the participant's head and secured appropriately to serve as a reference for reproducible coil placement and orientation.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>EMG data were measured bilaterally through surface electrode pairs, but responses to cortical stimulation were only recorded from the electrodes contralateral to the hemisphere being stimulated. Surface EMG signals were amplified and filtered with an Isolated Bioelectric Amplifier (James Long, Caroga Lake, NY), with bandpass filter settings of 30 and 1000 Hz, and digitally sampled at 1 KHz. 100 ms of prestimulation activity and 200 ms of post-stimulation activity were recorded. Trials in which active contraction contaminated the MEP were omitted, and the trial was repeated. To facilitate subject alertness throughout data collection, the investigator monitoring recordings engaged in neutral conversation with each volunteer between blocks of presentations of stimuli.</p><p>Stimulation of each hemisphere at the motor cortex using a 9 cm diameter figure-8 coil MAGSTIM 200 (Magstim Company Ltd., Whitland, Dyfed, UK) was performed in a systematic fashion at 0.2 Hz. The coil was oriented with the handle facing backward so the induced current in the brain was in the posterior-anterior direction during the rising phase of the monophasic pulse. Approximately 300&#x02013;400 stimuli were delivered in sequential order during the mapping procedure.</p><p>Potential hotspot sites were identified using a stimulus intensity that evoked MEPs &#x02265; 25 &#x003bc;V, in five out of ten trials. Once these cortical sites were identified, the intensity was reduced until the hotspot and the hotspot's excitability threshold for the EDC were determined. Thereafter, the stimulus intensity was increased by ten percent and cortical sites beginning at the hotspot were stimulated to identify the active sites. Mapping was complete when all surrounding inactive sites were identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p>The assumption of sphericity was ensured using the Greenhouse-Geisser correction. A two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to explore the difference between sessions, hemispheres, lesion location and the interaction within participants for the following variables: resting motor threshold, map area, mean peak-to-peak MEP amplitude for the hotspot, normalized map volume, slope of recruitment curve, COG centroid and COG distance A and B. For all tests the alpha level was set at &#x003b1; = 0.05. The Euclidean equation was applied to determine the distance the hotspot and COG locations traveled from sessions: one to two (distance A) and two to three (distance B).</p><p>To allow for comparison between sessions in a single hemisphere, a centroid point, <italic>Xc, Yc</italic>, was calculated from the three x-and y-co-ordinates for the COG and hotspot positions.

Consistent between hemisphere measures were obtained for the number of active sites, COG distance and recruitment curve slope, when recording EDC maps using single pulse TMS among patients greater than 2 years after stroke. In contrast, between hemispheres variability was observed in three measures: the average MEP amplitude, normalized map volume and resting motor threshold.</p><p>These findings support previous studies which report reproducible motor maps of the abductor pollicis brevis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and abductor digiti minimi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] in both healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and chronic stroke patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><sec><title>Interhemispheric variability collapsed across the three mapping sessions</title><p>Our data are in accord with previous reports on patients with stroke showing that resting motor threshold is significantly higher and MEP amplitudes are smaller in the affected hemisphere compared to the less affected hemisphere and that the relationship is reproducible between sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The larger normalized map volume of EDC in the damaged hemisphere may be due to the dynamic alteration in the pattern of brain activity in response to change in afferent signals, efferent signals and/or adjustment to injury (i.e. neuroplasticity). In the current study, six of ten patients reported strokes that primarily affected their dominant upper extremity. Although behavioral data were not collected prior to TMS mapping, all patients reported living within their communities and using their more impaired upper extremities for many activities of daily living. None of the volunteers were receiving formal training (i.e. constraint induced therapy) at the time of testing, however, they would have met the inclusion criteria to participate in a randomized clinical trial of constraint induced therapy that required initiation of wrist and finger extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Their repetitive efforts at using the more impaired arm may have contributed to modifying functional reorganization of remaining cortical tissue in the corresponding hemisphere. This use may have consequently led to a comparably larger map size.</p><p>Motor or sensory activity in one arm can affect the other arm. There is the potential for input from the ipsilateral (ie. less impaired hand) side to the damaged side of the brain. Frequent use of the less impaired limb may have led to a map volume increase on the ipsilateral (affected hemisphere). There is now evidence that such modulatory effects can occur with practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and has the potential to occur with mild or strong voluntary contractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Further data collection is necessary to completely explore this theory.</p><p>The much greater COG movement across sessions in the damaged hemispheres of stroke patients than in undamaged hemispheres of both stroke patients and comparison group is likely related to greater map volume in the damaged hemispheres. The calculation of COG x- and y-coordinates is dependent upon MEP amplitude (nMEP), and normalized map volume (nMV). The normalized map volume is directly proportional to the number of active sites. Large intersession variation in either of these values will affect the COG value and subsequent calculation of displacement between sessions. Although the variability in MEP amplitude was comparable between hemispheres, closer inspection of the data indicated up to a 58% greater variation in the number of active sites between sessions on the affected hemisphere (mean = 8.13 &#x000b1; 03.94) compared to the unaffected hemisphere (mean = 8.3 &#x000b1; 02.30). The increased variability in the number of active sites in the affected hemisphere is a contributing factor to the greater COG movement between sessions observed in the affected hemisphere.</p></sec><sec><title>Overall COG movement across three sessions for each participant and both hemispheres</title><p>The center of gravity remained consistent over the three sessions, with the majority of movement occurring in the anterior or posterior directions, along the Y-axis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), an observation consistent with the TMS-induced field generated from the figure of eight coil orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The average COG movement in the less affected hemisphere, 0.68 (&#x000b1; 0.04) cm is equivalent to the average COG movement 0.68 (&#x000b1; 0.02) cm measured from EDC in nine able bodied adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The average COG movement in the affected hemisphere reported here is about 60% greater when compared to the less affected hemisphere (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">4</xref>). These changes in COG shift between session and across hemispheres are considerably larger than measures reported by Liepert et al. in a previous study of stroke patients' undergoing an intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Their measurement for COG displacement in the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) was 0.234 &#x000b1; 0.21 cm in the media-lateral axis in the affected hemisphere and 0.153 &#x000b1; 0.18 cm in the less affected hemisphere and 0.71 &#x000b1; 0.47 and 0.50 &#x000b1; 0.426 cm in the anterior-posterior axis for the affected and less affected hemispheres, respectively.</p><p>The difference in magnitude may be a function of how COG displacement is determined between sessions. Our calculation of the Euclidean distance is fundamentally different than that described by Liepert et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Liepert's description of the shift in COG between sessions using displacement is useful because it provides an indication of both distance and directional change along one axis. However, concern should be given to the use of a mean displacement, expressed as the difference between two consecutive x- or y-coordinates without considering the absolute value of the calculation. Failure to consider the overall positive and negative directionality of displacement may have led to artificially lower COG shifts in value than seen in the current study (i.e. if first value is negative and second is of equal value positive). In contrast the resulting Euclidean distance between two points is an absolute value. Calculating the Euclidean distance between two points in a plane using the Pythagorean Theorem allows for the creation of a 2-dimensional displacement vector which can better describe the overall change in location between sessions independent of direction.</p><p>The calculation of COG is dependent on MEP characteristics which differ for distal and more proximal muscles. For instance, the MEP thresholds in proximal muscles (i.e. deltoid, biceps brachii) are higher and the responses vary more in amplitude from trial to trial than in distal muscles such as abductor pollicis brevis and flexor carpi radialis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, the form and structure of MEPs in proximal muscles is often more complex than in distal muscles. Although not statistically different, larger variation in EDC amplitude from trial to trial could be linked to the observed increases in COG movement between sessions because a single large amplitude MEP can have a significant weighting on the overall mean of 10 samples which is then used for subsequent statistical calculation.</p><p>Additionally, McDonnell et al. (2004) have noted sufficiently large variability in MEPs recorded under standard conditions so that no significant differences in their magnitude over time can be revealed by conventional statistical analysis (ANOVA). They suggested that if a change in MEP size is expected as a result of an intervention, the change in magnitude must be large or many trials must be included in the analysis, before significant differences can be demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore a reproducibly large change in MEP amplitude is necessary for significant movement in COG over sessions. However substantial variability in MEPs over trials may also increase COG movement.</p></sec><sec><title>Centroid of COG in both hemispheres among individual patients and able-bodied adults</title><p>The calculation of a centroid permits visualization of a geometric locus for COG among cerebral hemispheres of our stroke and able-bodied participants. One would predict slight variations in cortical representation of the EDC between hemispheres. However, there are no predicable shifts in COG from session1 to session 3. Our data provide evidence that there is relative consistency in chronic stroke patients not receiving an intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>MEP characteristics displaying stability between sessions</title><p>In this study we observed large fluctuations in MEP amplitude, even under carefully controlled conditions. A previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] found that regardless of the variation in the MEP amplitude, TMS map positions and areas are remarkably stable, with variations on the order of 1 mm for map position and less than 5% for map area. Likewise, our standard deviation in COG values was very small, with a mean value of 1.1 mm in latitude and 1.3 mm in longitude across subjects. In addition, the standard deviation of mean map area was only 1.1 cm<sup>2 </sup>(3.0%) across subjects. This high stability in COG has been observed in serial studies of patients with unilateral motor problems, in which the less affected side was stable to within 2&#x02013;3 mm over periods from weeks to years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In our patients with chronic stroke, the average COG movement across sessions in the less affected hemisphere was comparable to those shown previously in able bodied individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], while COG movement across sessions in the affected hemisphere varied more on average than seen among those individuals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">4</xref>). This increased variability may have resulted from our patients sustaining an uncontrolled 'relaxed' state compared to a controlled low-level voluntary contraction at 10% of maximum root-mean-square EMG activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Nonetheless, the COG variability found in our study was insignificant, producing a reliable measure for each patient's hemispheres for all three mapping sessions.</p></sec><sec><title>MEP characteristics showing high variability</title><p>The high trial-to-trial variability of MEP amplitude may be attributed to a number of factors. First, a range of cellular excitability levels in both spinal and upper motoneurons, which, under some circumstances, may bring these cells very close to firing threshold without actually discharging. In the case of the upper motoneuron, inherent excitability levels could allow some neurons to reach their discharge threshold but without the appropriate numbers or sufficient spinal synaptic excitability to temporally or spatially enhance EDC motoneuron discharge. Thus, mapping in the relaxed state is complicated by the variations that may occur in corticospinal excitability but could not be measured by monitoring EMG activity.</p><p>A second factor that can contribute to the intrinsic differences in MEP amplitude is variability in the desynchronization of the efferent volley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Spontaneous physiological oscillations in motoneuron excitability at both the cortical and spinal levels are uncontrollable and unobservable factors potentially causing significant fluctuations in response size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Changes in the state of the participant's alertness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], levels of muscle tonicity, or anticipation of movement-specific factors, such as mental imagery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], may also contribute to intra-trial MEP variability.</p><p>A third factor contributing to MEP variability may be stimulus intensity. This study recorded MEPs using stimulus intensities of 110% of motor threshold. When using higher stimulus intensities, as reported in some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] there are more motoneurons activated and, therefore, fewer are available to spontaneously discharge in concert and contribute to the MEP amplitude, thereby affecting variability.</p><p>Small alterations in the position of the coil also can produce a source of within-subject variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Although the experimenter can make every effort to hold the coil in a uniform manner on a given scalp location, the identical spot is probably not stimulated at each session. The figure-8 coil can be rotated slightly, yet be the source of immense change in the area of the cortex being stimulated.</p><p>Although stimulation with a figure-of-eight coil is often described as focal; 'focusing' the electromagnetic field is in fact not practical. The maximum field is generated at the point under the intersection of the two wings of a figure of 8 coil; however, a divergent field is created surrounding this point. As a result, the spatial distribution of induced current flow can still be quite large, and the possibility of exciting cells under the wings and even cells located some distance from their intersection exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>These factors can produce substantial variations in results obtained from TMS mapping studies. Although some of these factors are near impossible to control in a mapping session, others, such as coil placement and focal stimulation or the level of subject attentiveness, should be addressed as a precursor to TMS mapping studies designed to exploit variables using this modality to interpret results from specific interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrode Placements</title><p>We chose the use of closely spaced surface electrodes to measure motor evoked potentials from the EDC because this placement limits the evoked MEPs to the underlying muscle and its associated movement. Previous TMS studies used widely spaced electrode arrays. For example, the placement of electrodes over the abductor pollicis brevis records a wide range of movements caused by the flexor pollicis brevis, adductor pollicis, opponens pollicis or interossei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. When comparing evoked responses using typical montage and closer spaced electrode arrays, we demonstrated larger map volumes with the montage configuration compared to close electrode placement. The summation of MEPs that represent multiple muscles seen by the more widely spaced electrode configuration results in greater MEP amplitudes, map volumes, number of active sites, and steeper recruitment curve slopes; however, there is greater difficulty identifying which muscles contribute to the response with each cortical stimulation and the representative movements they subsume. This consideration is important in TMS studies that relate changes in map attributes to function. For example, in mapping the APB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], by knowing that the traditional placements also monitor volume conducted responses from muscles with a flexion function, would increased maps be teleologically relevant to an intervention designed to enhance movement in patients with stroke?</p></sec><sec><title>Functional Ramifications</title><p>Another unique aspect of our study was the focus on activation of the EDC and extension of the fingers. This movement is important in retraining function among patients with stroke, because hand extensor muscles are typically weak or inactive while muscles with a flexion function are disinhibited. Placement of wide spaced EDC surface electrodes previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] may actually record motions that are counterproductive to the benefits inherent in the very therapy being instituted.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study is one of the very few to examine variability in TMS responses among a small group of patients with chronic stroke. Even with the use of chronic stroke patients and closely spaced electrodes, similarities to previous studies using able-bodied subjects were found. However, not surprisingly, findings that were significantly different from these prior studies were also observed.</p><p>Closely spaced electrode placement is important for properly isolating movements in limb muscles. Therefore, TMS studies using this placement array need to be undertaken to determine if resultant maps replicate those generated from previous studies employing more traditional, wider spaced electrode configurations. The potential causes of variability identified in this study, the precision of electrode recordings, or entirely new analysis methods should be considered in an effort to accurately assess pharmacological or physical interventions and their impact on cortical organization.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AB, SK and SW conceived of the study, participated in its design, participated in the data collection and drafted the manuscript.

Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairment, cognitive deterioration and psychiatric disturbances followed by death within 10-15 years of the onset of the symptoms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>. HD is caused by the expansion of cytosineadenine-guanine (CAG, translated into glutamine) trinucleotide repeats in the first exon of the human huntingtin (<italic>HTT</italic>) gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>. Mutant <italic>HTT</italic> with expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) is widely expressed in the brain and peripheral tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, but causes selective neurodegeneration that is most prominent in the striatum and cortex of the brain. Although rodent models of HD have been developed, these models do not satisfactorily parallel the brain changes and behavioural features observed in HD patients. Because of the close physiological<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, neurological and genetic similarities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> between humans and higher primates, monkeys can serve as very useful models for understanding human physiology and diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>. Here we report our progress in developing a transgenic model of HD in a rhesus macaque that expresses polyglutamine-expanded <italic>HTT</italic>. Hallmark features of HD, including nuclear inclusions and neuropil aggregates, were observed in the brains of the HD transgenic monkeys. Additionally, the transgenic monkeys showed important clinical features of HD, including dystonia and chorea. A transgenic HD monkey model may open the way to understanding the underlying biology of HD better, and to the development of potential therapies. Moreover, our data suggest that it will be feasible to generate valuable non-human primate models of HD and possibly other human genetic diseases.</p></abstract><contract-num rid="NS1">R01 NS041669-07</contract-num><contract-num rid="NS1">R01 NS036232-09</contract-num><contract-num rid="AG1">R01 AG019206-07</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="NS1">National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke : NINDS</contract-sponsor><contract-sponsor id="AG1">National Institute on Aging : NIA</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front></article>

The data are stored in various formats and accessed through numerous interfaces. It is very difficult to exchange and integrate the data among different cancer institutions, even among different research labs within the same institution, in order to discover useful biomedical knowledge for the healthcare community. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a caGrid-enabled caBIG<sup>TM</sup> silver level compatible head and neck cancer tissue database system. The system is implemented using a set of open source software and tools developed by the NCI, such as the caCORE SDK and caGrid. The head and neck cancer tissue database system has four interfaces: Web-based, Java API, XML utility, and Web service. The system has been shown to provide robust and programmatically accessible biomedical information services that syntactically and semantically interoperate with other resources.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>caBIG<sup>TM</sup> compatible level</kwd><kwd>caCORE SDK</kwd><kwd>caGrid</kwd><kwd>head and neck cancer</kwd><kwd>cancer tissue database</kwd><kwd>model driven architecture</kwd><kwd>semantic interoperability.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Biomedical research labs have used various tools to generate data of unprecedented depth, timeliness and diversity for scientists and clinicians to attack the problems of preventing and curing human cancer. The diversity of data utilizes heterogeneous storage formats (plain text, Excel spreadsheet, Access database, various SQL databases, etc), different database schemas, metadata, and various interfaces for accessing the data. This diversity impedes the integration and interoperation of disparate data systems created in each research lab for the purposes of performing data analyses of multiple types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The solution to this problem is to build data systems utilizing an architecture that facilitates such interoperability.</p><p>In 2003, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) launched the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG<sup>TM</sup>), an international collaboration to facilitate and enable research teams to share data, applications, and infrastructure that facilitate collaborations that accelerate the conversion of data from information to knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. To accomplish this goal, the caBIG<sup>TM </sup>community is developing standards, policies, guidelines, common applications, open-source tools, and middleware infrastructure to enable more effective sharing of data and research tools among scientists and organizations in a multi-institutional environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. In the latest version (v3.0) of the caBIG<sup>TM</sup> Compatibility Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], four maturity levels of interoperability between systems are described: legacy, bronze, silver, and gold.</p><p>Under the leadership of the NCI, its Center for Bioinformatics (NCICB) and caBIG<sup>TM</sup> participants, many infrastructures, tools, and services (such as: caGrid 1.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], cancer Common Ontological Representation Environment Software Development Kit (caCORE SDK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], Semantic Integration Workbench (SIW), and UML Model Loader 4.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]) have been implemented to help design, develop, and deploy data and analytical services with full syntactic and semantic interoperability.</p><p>caGrid is an underlying Grid middleware infrastructure for caBIG<sup>TM</sup> to support fully syntactic and semantic interoperability among resources through a federation of such resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. caGrid is a model-driven and service-oriented architecture that synthesizes and extends a number of technologies such as Globus Toolkit, Mobius Global Model Exchange (Mobius GME), cancer Data Standards Repository (caDSR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], ActiveBPEL, Grouper, etc. to provide a standardized framework for the advertising, discovery, and invocation of data and analytical resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The latest release version is caGrid 1.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. caGrid 1.2 provides the common grid infrastructure upon which the caBIG<sup>TM</sup> silver level compliant grid services and tools are built.</p><p>caCORE is an interoperability infrastructure based on Model Driven Architecture (MDA), n-tier architecture, and a common application programming interface (API) for data access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Biomedical data systems built using the caCORE fulfill both aspects of interoperability: exchanging data (syntactic interoperability) and processing the exchanged data (semantic interoperability) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The caCORE infrastructure consists of an integrated set of three components: a controlled terminology service (the EVS), a standards-based metadata repository (the caDSR), and an information system with an API based on domain MDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>].</p><p>The term &#x0201c;<bold>head and neck cancer&#x0201d;</bold> refers to a group of biologically similar cancers originating from the upper aerodigestive tract, including the lip, oral cavity (mouth), nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, pharynx, and larynx. Head and neck cancer is highly curable if detected early. The effective treatment for head and neck cancer is usually some kind of surgery, but chemotherapy and radiation therapy may also play important roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p>We designed and implemented the head and neck cancer tissue database (HNCTD) system following the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG<sup>TM</sup>) paradigm. The system fully supports syntactic and semantic interoperability. It is caBIG<sup>TM</sup> silver level compatible according to caBIG<sup>TM</sup> compatibility guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. The HNCTD is an Internal Review Board (IRB)-approved Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant data system. Currently, the HNCTD contains information on 209 cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) from 1996-2003. All tissues in the database are formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues housed at either Emory University Hospital or Emory Midtown Hospital. Information from consented patients is extracted from the Surgical Pathology files in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].</p><p>The information in the HNCTD includes date of birth, date of diagnosis, tumor site, tumor stage and grade, smoking history, radiation treatment, chemotherapy treatment, date of recurrence, and date of last follow up or date of death. In addition, if the patient developed a second primary tumor the related information was also documented. The database is divided into two groups: no metastases (NoMET) and metastases (MET).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>We designed and implemented the head and neck cancer tissue database system based on the caBIG<sup>TM</sup> paradigm. We utilize the open source software such as ArgoUML (the UML modeling tool) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], caCORE SDK 4.0, caGrid 1.2, and Introduce (the caGrid service creation toolkit) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], etc. The process flow for the system design is shown in Fig. (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>).</p><p>The algorithmic steps for the process flow are described as:</p><sec><title>Begin:</title><p>Step 1: Build the object and data models using a Unified Modelling Language (UML) modeling tool such as Enterprise Architect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] or ArgoUML</p><p>Step 2: There are several separate steps in running Semantic Integration Workbench (SIW):</p><p>Step 2.1 (by Model Owner): Review unannotated XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) or UML file built in Step 1.</p><p>Step 2.2 (by Model Owner): Perform XMI or UML roundtrip.</p><p>Step 2.3 (by Model Owner): Run semantic connector.</p><p>If no errors such as invalid data types and &#x0201c;unbounded array&#x0201d; in model found in steps 2.1-2.3, then proceed to step 2.4; otherwise, go to step 1 to correct the errors and repeat steps 2.1-2.3.</p><p>Step 2.4 (by Vocabulary Reviewer): Send XMI or UML file <italic>via</italic> email to the NCICB to curate the file.</p><p>Step 2.5 (by Model Owner): Review annotated XMI or UML file.</p><p>Step 2.6 (by Model Owner): Generate default Global Model Exchange (GME) tags.</p><p>Step 2.7 (by Model Owner): GME cleanup.</p><p>If no errors found in steps 2.4-2.7, then proceed to step 3; otherwise, go to step 1 to correct the errors and repeat steps 2.1-2.7.</p><p>Step 3: Run UML Loader by the NCICB to load the approved annotated XMI or UML file into the caDSR which can be accessed at runtime.</p><p>Step 4: Run the caCORE SDK with the approved annotated XMI or UML file to generate the &#x02018;caCORE-like&#x02019; data system to provide &#x02018;strongly typed objects&#x02019; and object relational mapping access to the backend head and neck cancer tissue database.</p><p>Step 5: Run Introduce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] with the approved, annotated XMI or UML file and generated caCORE-like system artifacts to define the grid data service interface over the object oriented APIs that define functionality exposed to the caGrid.</p></sec><sec><title>End.</title><p>According to step 1, we first need to create the object and data models for the underlying database system. Here, we use ArgoUML 0.26, a freeware application, to create the models. The output of this procedure is a UML (XML format) file. As we mentioned before, the head and neck cancer tissue database is divided into two groups: metastasis and non-metastasis. Therefore, we model domain objects in two classes. Screenshots of the object and data models in ArgoUML 0.26 are shown in Figs. (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>).</p><p>One design requirement of the HNCTD is that principle investigators (PIs) and researchers who use the system can add new columns (biomarks) to the existing MET and NoMET tables, which means the database schema changes over time. In next subsection, we describe the principle of a semi-automatic time variant schema-enabled UML file generator. Basically, it is a reengineering process to get new domain object and data models using existing database schema.</p></sec><sec><title>Semi-Automatic Time Variant Schema-Enabled UML File Generator</title><p>We are able to automate the generation of the UML file each time the HNCTD schema is modified. A script is run on the web server at intervals specified by the administrator. The script queries the database and returns every column. The query is then compared to a previous query to check for any changes in the database&#x02019;s state. If a change has been detected, the script modifies the UML file appropriately and notifies the administrator of the change <italic>via</italic> e-mail. The administrator can run the SIW to check the new UML file and submit it to the NCICB for annotation and loading into the caDSR. The UML file in use by the caCORE SDK is replaced by the modified UML file so that access to up-to-date data is always available. The process flow of the semi-automatic time variant schema-enabled UML file generator is shown in Fig. (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>). The script is available for downloading at: <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://sisyphus.emory.edu/UML_generator.zip">http://sisyphus.emory.edu/UML_generator.zip</uri>.</p></sec><sec><title>System Architecture</title><p>Because the database contains identifiable patient information, such as patient&#x02019;s name, medical record number, date of birth, etc., we prioritize the security of the whole data system to make it a HIPAA compliant. We integrate the Common Security Module (CSM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], Grid Authentication, and Authorization with Reliably Distributed Services (GAARDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] into the system architecture. The high level architecture of the caGrid-enabled caBIG<sup>TM</sup> silver level compatible HNCTD system is shown in Fig. (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>).</p><p>As we mentioned before, we apply the caCORE SDK 4.0 with CSM enabled to our approved annotated model to generate a &#x02018;caCORE-like&#x02019; data system. The generated data system only supports querying (to be discussed in Results section), but not data input (to be discussed in Results section). Therefore the data system is read-only.</p><p>In Fig. (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>), there are three workflows (red line, green line, and orange line) to support the web-based user interface and one workflow (blue line) to support the caGrid data service API.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Workflow 1 (red line): The PIs and researchers of the head and neck cancer Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] are internal users of the database system. They can interact with the web browsers to retrieve the archived head and neck cancer tissue data and input new tissue information. Results section will describe the design of this data input interface.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Workflow 2 (green line): The CSM administrator utilizes the User Provisioning Tool (UPT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], a web-based management tool for authentication and authorization of users of the underlying database system, to set up credentials and different levels of access privileges for data, methods, and objects for external users. The CSM uses the credential provider&#x02019;s database to authenticate and the common authorization schema and database to authorize.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Workflow 3 (orange line): The head HNCTD system&#x02019;s external users use web browsers to query the tissue data. Firstly, the system will interact with the integrated CSM for authentication. If a user&#x02019;s credentials are valid, the user can query the database according on assigned access privileges.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Workflow 4 (blue line): The HNCTD system also provides the caGrid data service API for third party applications to access the database with GAARDS-enabled security control. This data service interface supports fully syntactical and semantic integration among disparate systems.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Data Input Interface</title><p>In order for the designed database system to be useful, we provide a data input interface. Because the caCORE SDK 4.0 does not support an API for writing data, we choose to design and implement the data input subsystem separately.</p><p>The data input subsystem is designed with collaboration and security in mind. There are two kinds of users of this subsystem: system administrators and common users (clinicians, researchers, and biostatisticians). Administrators are able to customize each user&#x02019;s specific levels of access (such as the addition of new columns, and the reading, writing, and deletion of certain fields and patient data). This enables researchers to view necessary data and allows for the ability to share information while maintaining patient&#x02019;s privacy. Users are able to export their data (in a tab-delimited text file and/or an excel file) for offline use. Users are also able to do the simple search by patient&#x02019;s name, medical record number (MRN), Case Number, or De-Identified Number. The data input interface is accessible at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://wci9.cc.emory.edu/spore">https://wci9.cc.emory.edu/spore</uri>.</p><p>The technical specifications for our data input subsystem are provided in Appendix 1.</p><p>Here we provide a successful application example of research project using our database. The project is to study the difference in a biomarker, Intergrin Beta 1, between non metastasis and metastasis patients. A dataset consisting of 101 metastasis and 106 non metastasis patients is collected using our database and exported by a user (Z. Chen). Some of analysis results with the dataset, such as a scatter plot of patient&#x02019;s Intergrin Beat 1 by his/her age and a boxplot for comparison of Intergrin Beta 1 between non metastasis and metastasis patients, are shown in Figs. (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref></bold>), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Query Interface</title><p>We developed the HNCTD data query subsystem using caCORE SDK 4.0 with CSM enabled. The generated system has four kinds of user query interfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]: (1) Web-based, which helps users view data in the form of a web page with a web browser. The CSM-enabled web-based query interface is accessible at: <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://velda.emory.edu:8081/spore">http://velda.emory.edu:8081/spore</uri>.; (2) XML utility-based, which facilitates thin clients to communicate with the generated data system with an XML-based REST interface; (3) Java API-based, which enables a Java program to be developed with this API to communicate with the generated data system; (4) Web service-based, which allows an application to be built by calling the Web service API to communicate with the generated &#x02018;caCORE-like&#x02019; data system.</p><p>Besides these four interfaces, we also use Introduce 1.2, an integrated tool from caGrid 1.2 to create and deploy a GAARDS-enabled caGrid data service for the caCORE SDK generated data system. For detail steps for creating, deploying, and invoking the data service please refer to the Introduce tutorial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>].</p><p>The technical specifications for data query subsystem are provided in Appendix 2.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>To further improve treatment for cancer patients, it is necessary to conduct translational studies which link clinical outcomes with tissue based molecular data and unravel the mechanism of cancer in the molecular point of view. Some of the challenges in contemporary cancer translational research include, but not limited to, data sharing, data complexity, and organizational complexity. A sharing database built with the caBIG<sup>TM</sup> paradigm is the answer for these challenges. Our database is established with the core of caBIG<sup>TM</sup> paradigm, such as the XML, model driven architecture, object-relational mapping, semantic web, and grid computing technologies. Therefore, our database is easy to upgrade in the future and a similar database as ours can be easily established in other institutes according to their needs. In the market, caTissue is a good alternative caBIG<sup>TM</sup>&#x02019;s biorepository tool for biospecimen inventory management, tracking, and annotation. This tool enables users to contribute and retrieve data for the purpose of tissue storage, quality assurance, and distribution of biospecimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. caTissue suite is open source, but its full service support requires high license fee.</p><p>Our HNCTD system mainly stores head &#x00026; neck cancer clinical information. The system is designed and developed according to caBIG<sup>TM</sup> paradigm. It facilitates the data sharing based on the open standards and has a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to help access the patient data in the database. Because the HNCTD stores patient&#x02019;s identity and private information, we put a lot of efforts for the security of the system in order to satisfy the HIPAA requirements. The HNCTD system also has some limitations. For example, it does not support the storage and retrieval of biospecimen such as image; it cannot integrate with the OnCore clinical system running in Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University; and it has not been integrated with caTissue Suite running in Emory University. But we are endeavoring to overcome these limitations by redesigning the system with caCORE SDK 4.1 after a future release of caGrid is available.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The HNCTD system is developed based on the caBIG<sup>TM</sup> paradigm. It demonstrates the effectiveness of rapid application development for building &#x02018;caCORE-like&#x02019; data system using model driven architecture (MDA) and n-tier distributed computing architecture methodology. The system is built with a set of open source applications that are easily accessible to any application development team. We deploy our caCORE SDK-generated data system on the caGrid infrastructure using the Introduce toolkit to make the whole system caBIG<sup>TM</sup> silver level compatible. The HNCTD system realizes the syntactical and semantic interoperability among multisite which host the head &#x00026; neck tissue data. In addition, the system has a lot of special features, such as: reporting, user management, logging, and adding/deleting new biomarkers.</p><p>Currently, the HNCTD is just open to the SPORE PIs, researchers, and biostatisticians. For the external users, he/she should register first and wait for the system administrator&#x02019;s approval. In the future, we are going to advance the HNCTD by developing analytical services for the data mining of stored head and neck cancer tissue information. Also, we will develop a sophisticated time variant schema-enabled UML file generator for more general user case. We will also redesign the system to adopt caCORE SDK 4.1 (for the support of an API which enables data input) once we obtain a future release of caGrid.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Karen Lyn Exline and Belinda Maaskant for their assistance in configuring the web and application servers, as well as Kenneth Buck for his assistance in setting up the Oracle 10g database.

However, the efficient repair of DNA DSBs in the tumors makes the tumors radioresistant, which frequently prevents successful treatment. Therefore, identifying new practical sensitizers is an essential step towards successful radiotherapy. Mammalian cells require two major DNA DSB repair pathways: non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination repair (HRR). The human cell lines that are deficient in the DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) or ATM are sensitive to IR because of the inefficient DNA DSB repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011397-Jackson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011397-vanGent1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

We used the lentiviral construct containing a <italic>pri</italic>-<italic>miR-101</italic> to transfect different cell lines in two different ways: 1.

We used the lentiviral construct with the viral helper to infect one human GBM cell line, U87MGD cells, and collected the cells at 48&#x02013;72 h after infection. (The data derived from the 95D cells over-expressed with <italic>miR-101</italic> were similar to that from the 95C cells up-expressed with <italic>miR-101</italic>, therefore, we showed one set of results from 95C cells in this manuscript only.)

To determine whether mTOR, similar to DNA-PK and ATM, also contributed to the sensitization of the cells to IR, we examined the sensitivity of the cells to IR after the mTOR level was knocked down by a siRNA or the mTOR activity was inhibited by rapamycin in the cells.

The data represent mean and SE of six mice for each group: &#x0002a;, p&#x0003c;0.05 and &#x0002a;&#x0002a;, p&#x0003c;0.01.</p><p>(1.17 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0011397.s007.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Erwin G.

Early detection would allow management to prevent or delay development of diabetes and diabetes-related complications. We investigated the economic justification for screening for pre-diabetes/diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>We projected health system and societal costs over 3 years for 1,259 adults, comparing costs associated with five opportunistic screening tests. All subjects had measurements taken of random plasma and capillary glucose (RPG and RCG), A1C, and plasma and capillary glucose 1 h after a 50 g oral glucose challenge test without prior fasting (GCT-pl and GCT-cap), and a subsequent diagnostic 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>Assuming 70% specificity screening cutoffs, Medicare costs for testing, retail costs for generic metformin, and costs for false negatives as 10% of reported costs associated with pre-diabetes/diabetes, health system costs over 3 years for the different screening tests would be GCT-pl $180,635; GCT-cap $182,980; RPG $182,780; RCG $186,090; and A1C $192,261; all lower than costs for no screening, which would be $205,966. Under varying assumptions, projected health system costs for screening and treatment with metformin or lifestyle modification would be less than costs for no screening as long as disease prevalence is at least 70% of that of our population and false-negative costs are at least 10% of disease costs. Societal costs would equal or exceed costs of no screening depending on treatment type.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Screening appears to be cost-saving compared to no screening from a health system perspective, and potentially cost-neutral from a societal perspective. These data suggest that strong consideration should be given to screening&#x02014;with preventive management&#x02014;and that use of GCTs may be cost-effective.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The prevalence and costs associated with diabetes and pre-diabetes challenge the financial integrity of our healthcare systems. However, screening would allow management aimed at preventing or delaying development of diabetes and complications and could possibly reduce costs. Recommendations regarding screening for pre-diabetes and diabetes have been made by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), but formal screening is infrequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Screening options include fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), but both require fasting samples that patients find inconvenient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), and it is not clear what the best screening strategy is&#x02014;another reason screening is under-performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). There is also controversy as to whether screening for diabetes is cost-effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Previous analyses of the costs of screening have often focused only on diabetes, have not compared different screening strategies, or have examined screening in only limited ways, e.g., have not included the downstream implications of detecting diabetes as well as pre-diabetes or have ignored the costs of false-negative and false-positive screening results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>We evaluated the economic justification for screening for diabetes and pre-diabetes. We estimated the costs of screening with random plasma or capillary glucose (RPG or RCG) and A1C tests, informal screening tests frequently used in routine practice, and a glucose challenge test (GCT) approach similar to that used to screen for gestational diabetes, along with the costs of management. Our objectives were to determine whether screening coupled with 3 years of preventive management is likely to be cost-effective compared with no screening, and if there is an optimal screening strategy from an economic perspective.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>The study was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board and utilized data from 1,259 adults in the Screening for Impaired Glucose Tolerance (SIGT) study, described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Briefly, this study recruited participants without known diabetes between January 2005 and March 2008. The subjects' first visit was at different times of the day, without an overnight fast. Random capillary and plasma glucose (RCG and RPG) were measured, a 50 g glucose drink was given, and capillary and plasma glucose 1 h after a 50 g oral glucose challenge test (GCT-cap and GCT-pl) were measured. At a second visit, after an overnight fast, A1C was drawn and a 75 g OGTT was begun before 11:00 <sc>a.m</sc>.</p><sec><title>Case definitions</title><p>Based on glucose levels that confer increased mortality, pre-diabetes included: <italic>1</italic>) impaired fasting glucose<sub>110</sub> (IFG<sub>110</sub>), fasting glucose 110&#x02013;125 mg/dl and 2-h OGTT glucose &#x0003c;140 mg/dl; <italic>2</italic>) impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), fasting glucose &#x0003c;110 mg/dl and 2-h OGTT glucose 140&#x02013;199 mg/dl; and <italic>3</italic>) IFG<sub>110</sub> with IGT (IFG+IGT), fasting glucose 110&#x02013;125 mg/dl and 2-h OGTT glucose 140&#x02013;199 mg/dl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Diabetes included fasting glucose &#x02265;126 mg/dl and/or 2-h OGTT glucose &#x02265;200 mg/dl.</p></sec><sec><title>Screening test characteristics</title><p>Sensitivities and specificities were calculated at different cutoffs, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated using logistic regression. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p></sec><sec><title>Screening test cutoffs</title><p>Cutoffs were based on sensitivity and specificity, as well as the optimality criterion (where ROC curve slope = [marginal cost of false positives/marginal cost of false negatives] &#x000d7; [prevalence of no disease/prevalence of disease]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Our base case analyses utilized 70% specificity cutoffs, as higher-specificity cutoffs are thought to be cost-effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cost assessment</title><p>Costs were expressed in 2007 U.S. dollars. Health system costs were assessed from a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)-as-payer perspective&#x02014;thus reflecting the types and levels of costs that would be incurred in the Medicare fee for service program&#x02014;and compared with Veterans Administration (VA) costs, to provide a single-payer perspective. Included were the direct medical costs associated with screening, the costs of false negatives, and the costs for true positive cases of pre-diabetes and diabetes. Societal costs included both the direct medical and direct nonmedical costs of testing, direct and indirect (lost labor productivity) costs of false negatives, and direct medical, direct nonmedical, and indirect costs of true positives. Base case assumptions are outlined below. Cost components for these analyses are provided in more detail in the online appendix available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc10-0054/DC1">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc10-0054/DC1</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Costs of testing</title><p>CMS-based direct costs of testing included costs for laboratory tests, cost of the GCT glucose drink, and staff costs. It was assumed that blood for GCT-pl, RPG, and OGTT would be drawn at an on-site laboratory. The direct nonmedical costs of testing reflected excess time spent by the patient. Since screening was assumed to be opportunistic (during a visit), the visit time was not included.</p></sec><sec><title>Costs of false negatives</title><p>For the base case analyses, the cost of a false negative (pre-diabetes or diabetes that was undetected) was evaluated as 10% of the projected marginal 3-year medical costs for that condition, assuming that marginal costs could be decreased by appropriate management, as they were in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The cost of a false negative was assumed to include the 3-year direct medical cost of diabetes, pre-diabetes, and/or pre-diabetes that progressed to diabetes. Direct medical costs for diabetes were based on Medical Expenditure Panel Survey costs from 2000&#x02013;2004, which came to $4,174/year in 2005 U.S. dollars for a 50-year-old person with new-onset diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Patients with IFG<sub>110</sub> in Kaiser Permanente Northwest had marginal direct medical costs of $1,316/year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), used for all patients with pre-diabetes (although IGT might incur higher costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]). In the DPP, treatment with metformin and lifestyle changes reduced medical costs outside of the study by 5&#x02013;9% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Since the DPP participants were all receiving medical follow-up through the study, the cost impact would likely be greater in the general population, in which close medical care for missed diagnoses would be lacking; 10% of projected costs was assigned as a reasonable amount that might be reduced by detection of the condition. A 3-year time period for the estimation of cost was chosen, because this is the period over which DPP costs were calculated and is also the time between ADA-recommended screenings.</p><p>Indirect costs for false negatives (absenteeism, reduced productivity at work, and unemployment) were derived from the ADA 2007 economic assessment and were attributed only to those with diabetes or whose pre-diabetes progressed to diabetes during the 3 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Costs of true positives</title><p>Direct medical costs for a true positive were based on 3-year costs for the DPP metformin group, in which marginal costs for laboratory tests, physician visits, and follow-up were $703 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>); we substituted current generic costs for metformin 850 mg twice a day. Direct medical costs incurred outside of the study, direct nonmedical costs, and indirect costs for the DPP metformin versus placebo arms were used as other components for the cost of true positives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>); direct medical costs outside the study were &#x02212;$329 for the metformin versus placebo arms. Societal costs included 3-year direct nonmedical costs (&#x02212;$11) and indirect costs ($278) in the metformin versus placebo arms.</p></sec><sec><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Screening cutoffs.</title><p>We considered alternative cutoffs for a positive screen: 90% sensitivity cutoffs, as well as cutoffs based on the optimality criterion (above).</p></sec><sec><title>Testing.</title><p>We evaluated 5 and 10 min of additional staff time for all tests.

False negatives: <italic>1</italic>) We assessed the impact of preventing fractions of direct medical costs ranging from 1&#x02013;40%; <italic>2</italic>) We examined DPP false-negative costs, which were $329 (the costs incurred by the placebo group outside of the DPP study), using this value (based on IGT with fasting glucose &#x0003e;95 mg/dl) for pre-diabetes, and twice this cost, $658, for diabetes. For alternative societal costs, indirect costs were based on the ADA economic analysis and taken conservatively as $68 over 3 years, which is our estimate of ADA's indirect costs for patients with pre-diabetes (online appendix Table A1) and twice this for patients with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>VA healthcare system.</title><p>We evaluated VA testing costs. Allowing for costs 50% above those of metformin itself, we evaluated an alternative true positive (VA-TP) cost of $165 per true positive over 3 years (approximately one-third of base case treatment costs). We also considered VA-TP alternative direct nonmedical and indirect costs to be approximately one-third of the direct nonmedical and indirect costs for treatment with metformin in the DPP study, &#x0223c;$90 combined (online appendix Table A1).</p></sec><sec><title>Lifestyle treatment.</title><p>We evaluated costs of treatment with lifestyle modification using DPP-based costs, assuming group intervention costs and costs for other lifestyle changes as described in the DPP protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The subjects had an average age of 48 years and BMI 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; they were 55% African American and 62% female; 19.5% had pre-diabetes (3.5% IFG<sub>110</sub> only, 12.5% IGT only, and 3.5% IFG+IGT), and 4.9% had diabetes. Dysglycemia (previously unrecognized pre-diabetes and diabetes) was present in 24.5%, and as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) was identified with greatest accuracy by GCT-pl and least well by RCG. For the different tests, 70% specificity cutoffs (true positives, and false negatives), respectively, would be: GCT-pl 138 mg/dl (248, 61); GCT-cap 162 mg/dl (214, 95); RPG 100 mg/dl (195, 114); RCG 106 mg/dl (156, 153); A1C 5.5% (202, 107).</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> shows base case health system and societal cost estimates for screening and 3 years of management in a system with Medicare fee-for-service reimbursement rates, with 70% specificity cutoffs, and assuming that false-negative costs (that could be prevented after detection of dysglycemia) amounted to 10% of 3-year medical costs. Cost components for these cost estimates are described in detail in online appendix Table A1. From both perspectives, total costs for testing (screening test + follow-up OGTT if indicated) were lowest for RCG because it was the least expensive test and had the fewest positive screens. Total true-positive costs were highest for GCT-pl from both perspectives, due to the higher numbers of true positives detected, while the cost of false negatives was highest for RCG because this test had the highest number of false negatives.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Base case cost assessment in health system and societal costs</p></caption><table

Societal costs were much higher than costs for no screening and higher than costs associated with treatment with metformin due to the significant direct nonmedical costs associated with the lifestyle intervention.</p><p>There has been recent interest in using A1C as both a screening and a diagnostic test for diabetes. We calculated the costs of using A1C 6.0&#x02013;6.4% to diagnose pre-diabetes and A1C &#x02265;6.5% to diagnose diabetes, without confirmatory testing. Health system costs, with our base case assumptions and using metformin and lifestyle modification for management, would be $226,122 and $225,944, respectively&#x02014;both higher than the costs with GCT or random glucose testing and higher than the cost of no screening, because of a large number of false negatives and treatment of false positives. Societal costs with metformin and lifestyle modification management would be $299,524 and $411,726, again higher than with other screening tests or with no screening.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This study evaluated the economic justification for a screening program that would detect both pre-diabetes and previously unrecognized diabetes. Over a 3-year horizon (typical of the duration of employer health insurance coverage for many workers), we compared the costs of no screening to the costs of screening with RPG, RCG, or A1C available today as well as novel GCT-pl and GCT-cap tests, and included the costs of management of detected cases. With Medicare-based costs and our base case assumptions, screening would be less expensive than no screening from a health system perspective and cost neutral or only slightly more expensive than no screening from a societal perspective; these results were robust to a variety of sensitivity analyses. GCT-pl screening had the greatest diagnostic accuracy, and, in many scenarios, would provide the lowest health system costs.</p><p>The sensitivity analyses performed include a wide range of assumptions and two ends of the spectrum of health system costs for treatment with metformin, Medicare- and VA-based. In both settings, the costs of testing would be only a minor portion of total costs, and testing costs with RCG would be least expensive. With more accurate tests (GCT-pl is best, RCG worst), the costs of true positives would rise and the costs of false negatives would fall. Overall, GCT-pl screening would be least expensive in settings with CMS reimbursement rates as well as in VA-based settings.</p><p>We estimated costs for treatment of true positives, both with metformin and lifestyle modification, based on the treatment protocol used in the DPP, but substituted drug costs to reflect current prices. However, some have suggested that such involved treatment might be impractical to implement in real-world settings. Recognizing this, we also examined an alternative care system: the VA. Costs in the VA are lower than Medicare testing and retail drug costs and might be representative of costs with a single-payer healthcare system. With these costs (VA-TP costs), screening with any of the tests would be cost-saving from both health system and societal perspectives.</p><p>Our analyses also revealed that screening for pre-diabetes and diabetes would involve a high cost for false negatives&#x02014;a high cost for undetected and untreated pre-diabetes and diabetes. This was not unexpected, since costs attributable to diabetes (before and after diagnosis) are substantial due to a combination of costs of hospitalizations related to complications (particularly cardiovascular disease), pharmacy costs, and other medical visits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>The finding that treatment of detected cases might be cost-saving from a health-system perspective is at least partly driven by the findings from the DPP study in which those participants who were treated with metformin or lifestyle changes had reduced medical costs outside of the study compared to those in the placebo arm. We do not have a mechanism through which these cost-savings were obtained, but they may have resulted from improvements in cardiovascular risk factors which have been associated with both types of treatment.</p><p>Our study has limitations. The study subjects were volunteers, which may have caused some selection bias. However, the prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes in our study is similar to that found in other studies and lower compared to recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). We did not consider screening with fasting plasma glucose in this study; however, accuracy should be at least as good and health system costs should be similar to those with RPG testing, so costs should still be favorable compared to no screening. The ADA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) has recommended that A1C be used for the diagnosis of diabetes and pre-diabetes, so screening with A1C measurements might involve either no follow-up testing or at most a repeat A1C if the first A1C were high, which differs from our main analysis, in which follow-up testing would involve an OGTT. Since A1C is a relatively inaccurate screening test, especially for pre-diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), an A1C-only screening strategy would increase screening costs but decrease both the projected costs for treatment (because fewer positives would be found), and the costs we attributed to patients who were A1C-negative but OGTT-positive (by defining such patients as true negatives). However, such an approach ignores the empirical findings of increased costs associated with pre-diabetes (above).</p><p>Our analysis also assumed that all adults would be screened for pre-diabetes/diabetes. If, however, screening targeted adults with one or more risk factors, the overall screening costs would decrease (due to fewer numbers being screened), and the relative proportion of true positives to false negatives should rise. In this case, the cost-effectiveness of screening should improve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), and the costs of screening and 3 years of management should become even more favorable relative to no screening, since the cost of treatment of true positives, in our estimation, is less than the average cost of false negatives.</p><p>We focused our analysis on costs related to treatment with metformin, but this may not be the best treatment. Lifestyle interventions emphasizing diet and weight loss are a better treatment from a medical and, possibly, also from a cost perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). However, metformin is a treatment that can be implemented in a consistent manner by most practitioners with fairly predictable results. Finally, the scope of our study was limited to the costs of one-time screening and did not incorporate the lifetime modeling needed to determine if the cost-savings we project over a 3-year period would continue with a program of repeated screening, as currently recommended by the ADA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, a 3-year period might be an ideal representation from the perspective of a payer working with employers whose employees come and go, and who change healthcare plans every few years.</p><p>Our analyses indicate that screening programs and 3 years of management for pre-diabetes and previously unrecognized diabetes should be cost-effective, particularly from a health system perspective, and may be cost-saving.</p></sec>

The Schofield equation based on weight and height has been reported to underestimate REE in female children with phenylketonuria (PKU). The objective of this observational, cross-sectional study was to evaluate the agreement of measured REE with predicted REE for female adolescents with PKU. A total of 36 females (aged 11.5-18.7 years) with PKU attending Emory University&#x02019;s Metabolic Camp (June 2002 &#x02013; June 2008) underwent indirect calorimetry. Measured REE was compared to six predictive equations using paired Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-tests, regression-based analysis, and assessment of clinical accuracy. The differences between measured and predicted REE were modeled against clinical parameters to determine to if a relationship existed. All six selected equations significantly under predicted measured REE (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.005). The Schofield equation based on weight had the greatest level of agreement, with the lowest mean prediction bias (144 kcal) and highest concordance correlation coefficient (0.626). However, the Schofield equation based on weight lacked clinical accuracy, predicting measured REE within &#x000b1;10% in only 14 of 36 participants. Clinical parameters were not associated with bias for any of the equations. Predictive equations underestimated measured REE in this group of female adolescents with PKU. Currently, there is no accurate and precise alternative for indirect calorimetry in this population.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>phenylketonuria</kwd><kwd>resting energy expenditure</kwd><kwd>indirect calorimetry</kwd></kwd-group><contract-num rid="RR1">UL1 RR025008-04
