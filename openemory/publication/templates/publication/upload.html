        <p>My use of the OpenEmory self-deposit method confirms that I grant to
          Emory University (“Emory”) the non-exclusive, perpetual license to
          preserve and reproduce the work, and to display, distribute and make
          the work publicly available without charge from the open access
          repository OpenEmory, or any successor initiative based at Emory, in
          any format.  As used here, a work is a scholarly article including
          all materials contained in the article, such as images.</p>
        <p>I represent and warrant to Emory that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I have the right to submit the work to OpenEmory and to grant
            Emory the license above, or I have unrestricted permission from the
            copyright owner, such as a publisher, for the work to be
            distributed in an open access repository.</li>
          <li>Distribution from OpenEmory of the work does not infringe or
            violate any copyright or other rights of a publisher or other third
            party.</li>
          <li>If the work contains material for which I do not hold copyright,
            such as images, I have obtained all necessary rights for the work
            and the material to be distributed in OpenEmory.</li>
          <li>If the work was prepared jointly with other authors, I am
            granting the license above on their behalf as well as my own, and
            am authorized to do so.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I understand that I will have the option of specifying an embargo
          date to comply with publisher or funder policies, and Emory will
          delay making the work publicly available from OpenEmory until that
          date. I understand that I may request to have public access to my
          work restricted by removing public display to my work, and that Emory
          may remove my work from public display if Emory deems distribution is
          inappropriate, such as violating the rights of a third party.</p>
        <p>I understand that this license is non-exclusive and does not prevent
          me from entering into similar arrangements with other parties or from
          exercising any rights that I may have in the work.  However, I
          understand that I may need to inform subsequent publishers or others
          that I have granted this license to distribute my work in
          OpenEmory.</p>
        <p>I understand that OpenEmory is currently only accepting journal
          articles.</p>
