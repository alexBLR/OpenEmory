# If configuring to run at a non-root url, e.g. hostname/readux/ ,
# you should update the both the script and static alias urls,
# configure the same value in localsettings.py as SITE_URL_PREFIX.
# The script alias should be configured without a trailing slash,
# so you may also want an apache rewrite rule like this:
#  RewriteRule ^/openemory$ openemory/  [L,R]
